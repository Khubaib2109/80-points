## 1. Objective

The game is played in teams of two: **Attackers** and **Defenders**.

The Attackers aim to score **at least 80 points** in a round.  
The Defenders aim to prevent this.

---

## 2. Deck and Point Cards

The game uses **two full decks of cards**.

Only the following cards score points:

- 5 — 5 points  
- 10 — 10 points  
- King — 10 points  

The maximum number of points available in a round is **200**.

---

## 3. Dealing and the Bottom Eight

Cards are picked up one at a time.

Eight cards are left face-down. These are known as the **bottom eight**.

The first player to pick up a **2** becomes the **starting player**, and their team defends first.  
That player then picks up the bottom eight cards and discards any eight cards back to the table.

**Note:**  
If the Attackers win the final trick of the round, any point cards that were originally in the bottom eight count as **double**.

---

## 4. Reshuffle Rule

Before any tricks are played:

If any player has **less than 25 total points** in their hand, they may request a reshuffle.  
If this occurs, all cards are redealt.

---

## 5. Trump Suit

The suit of the **first 2 picked up** becomes the **trump suit** (also referred to as the royal suit).

Trump cards beat all non-trump cards.

If **double jokers** are played, the round is played with **no trump suit**.

---

## 6. Tricks

A **trick** consists of one card (or set of cards) played by each player.

- One player leads the trick.
- Players must follow suit if possible.
- If a player cannot follow suit, they may play any card.

A trick is won by:
- the highest trump card played, or
- if no trump is played, the highest card of the led suit.

The winning team collects all cards played in that trick.

---

## 7. Doubles and Sisters

### Doubles

A **double** consists of two identical cards played together.

If a double is played, all other players must respond with doubles if they are able to do so.  
Doubles beat single cards.

### Sisters

**Sisters** consist of two consecutive doubles of the same suit (for example, two 7s and two 8s of the same suit).

Sisters are stronger than doubles.  
To beat sisters, a player must play **higher sisters**.

If sisters are played, players must play any doubles they hold in that suit if possible.

---

## 8. Scoring

Only the Attackers score points.

At the end of the round, the Attackers total the points from all tricks they have won.  
Point cards won by the Defenders do not count and are discarded.

If the Attackers win the final trick, applicable bottom-eight points are doubled.

---

## 9. Winning and Advancement

### Attackers

The Attackers advance as follows:

- 80+ points — win the round  
- 120+ points — advance 1 level  
- 160+ points — advance 2 levels  
- 200 points — advance 3 levels  

### Defenders

If the Attackers fail to reach 80 points, the Defenders advance:

- Attackers < 80 — advance 1 level  
- Attackers < 40 — advance 2 levels  
- Attackers score 0 — advance 3 levels  

---

## 10. New Round

All cards are reshuffled.

Team roles, the starting player, and the royal number for the next round are determined by the outcome of the previous round.
